<h1>About</h1> 
<!-- <h2>What is Imago?</h2> -->
<p>Imago is a prototypic 'next-generation' digital repository that is dynamically linked to scientific specimen 
collection databases.</p>

<p>Imago uses a Fedora 4 repository with Sufia 7 as an extensible Hydra Head with rich metadata that meets the 
Dublin and Darwin Core standards.  The repository holds 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional specimen images, associated 
text files, and other media types.  The dynamic linkage to Symbiota (an inter-institutional collaborative digitization 
platform) and Specify (a collection management software suite) enables the institutional master databases to propagate 
metadata for the digital resources to Imago, where they are publicly available.</p>

<p>The dynamic links provide cyberinfrastructure support for high-efficiency digitization workflows that typically have 
incremental compilation of metadata.  Skeletal database records created during specimen digitization can be augmented 
when the full collection information is added, and enhanced when collection localities are georeferenced.</p>

<p>The dynamic links also provide cyberinfrastructure support for the inherently dynamic nature of biodiversity 
research and biocollection curation.  Imago is a critical asset for an institutionally based, dynamic information 
system that efficiently curates these digital resources (along with the physical collections) as our knowledge of 
biodiversity advances, taxonomy changes, and specimens are annotated.  When biocollection information is updated 
in a master database, it propagates to all dependent records and digital resources, which are then available to data 
aggregators and other potential users of this publicly available information.</p>

<p>Imago means 'image' in Latin.  The biological term 'imago' refers the adult stage of insects after they have 
completed metamorphosis from earlier juvenile forms.  Specimen digitization forms the final stage of biocollection 
management, and at Indiana University, Imago is where our specimen images go.</p>


















<p>The Center for Biological Research Collections (CBRC) is a consortium of research-based scientific collections at Indiana University. The CBRC is funded by the College of Arts and Sciences,
  the Office for the Vice President for Research, the Department of Biology, the Department of Anthropology, and the Department of Geological Sciences.</p>
<p>The CBRC enhances collection-based research and education in biodiversity, zooarchaeology, paleontology, and related disciplines by providing shared infrastructural and data management
  support for IUâ€™s biological research collections. The Center focuses on collections of biological specimens, including fossils and archaeological remains that have shared taxonomic,
  geographic, and temporal metadata requirements.</p>
<p>This repository was developed by the Indiana University Libraries, in conjunction with the CBRC, to provide an archive for the digital assets generated in the Indiana University Herbarium,
  the Indiana University Paleontology Collection, and the William R. Adams Zooarchaeology Laboratory.</p>
